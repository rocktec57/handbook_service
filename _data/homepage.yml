  subhead: Empowering VA teams to build their own digital services on the Veteran Tools Platform
  p1: We created this Handbook based on VA's experience with <a title="Vets.gov" href="https://www.vets.gov" target="_blank">Vets.gov</a>, as well as best practices from government digital services, government agencies, and the technology industry. It's a tool to help VA teams create the best possible user experience for people interacting with Veteran-facing digital services.
  p2: The <i>Veteran Tools Platform</i> is the set of technologies (and processes) that power the <a title="Vets.gov" href="https://www.vets.gov" target="_blank">Vets.gov</a> website. While this Handbook provides specific direction for teams who plan to build on that platform, we hope other VA teams find it useful when building their own digital services.
  alert-title: Work in progress
  alert-copy: We'll be expanding and refining this Handbook during summer 2018.<br/>We encourage you to adopt as much of it as possible and <a title="Contact us" href="contact">share your feedback with us</a>.
