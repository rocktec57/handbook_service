  subhead: Empowering VA teams to build their own digital services on the Veteran Tools Platform
  p1: We created this Handbook based on VA's experience with <a title="Vets.gov" href="https://www.vets.gov" target="_blank">Vets.gov</a>, as well as best practices from government digital services, government agencies, and the technology industry. It's a tool to help VA teams create the best possible user experience for people interacting with Veteran-facing digital services.
  p2: While this Handbook provides direction for teams who want to build on the <i>Veteran Tools Platform</i>, we hope other VA teams find it useful when building their own digital services.
  alert-title: Work in progress
  alert-copy: We're currently expanding and refining this Handbook.<br/>We encourage you to adopt as much of it as possible and <a title="Share feedback" href="contact">share your feedback</a>.
