discovery:
  next-phase: alpha
  move-on: |
    **Move on to [alpha](alpha)** &mdash; the team feels confident they've answered the key questions and are ready to move to the alpha phase
  stay: |
    **Spend more time in discovery** &mdash; the team has additional additional questions that need to be answered before moving to the alpha phase
  stop: |
    **Stopping after the discovery phase is not a failure.**
    <br/>The purpose of discovery is to understand users and find out what they need. This may mean you need to change plans or take a new direction. **Finding this out in the discovery phase is the best possible outcome** (vs. finding out after you've built it or launched it).
    <br/>Your team should recommend stopping after discovery if your findings show

    * There's no user need for the service you planned to build
    * User needs are already being met by another service &mdash; whether government or private-sector
    * Technology or policy constraints mean you won’t be able to build a service that meets the user needs you've found
    * It’s not cost-effective to develop the service
alpha:
  next-phase: beta
  move-on: |
    **Move on to [beta](beta)** &mdash; the team feels confident they've tested their hypotheses, understand how to build the MVP service, and are ready to move to the beta phase
  stay: |
    **Spend more time in alpha** &mdash; the team has additional (or new) hypotheses they want to test before moving to the beta phase
  stop: |
    **Stopping after the alpha phase is not a failure.**
    <br/>The purpose of alpha is to figure out how you might build a solution to meet your users' needs. This may mean you need to change plans or take a new direction. **Finding this out in the alpha phase is the best possible outcome** (vs. finding out after you've built it or launched it).
    <br/>Your team should recommend stopping after alpha if your findings show

    * There's no user need for the service you planned to build
    * User needs are already being met by another service &mdash; whether government or private-sector
    * Technology or policy constraints mean you won’t be able to build a service that meets the user needs you've found
    * It’s not cost-effective to develop the service
beta:
  next-phase: live
  move-on: |
    **Move on to [live](live)** &mdash; the team feels confident the MVP meets users' basic needs, and the team is ready to launch it (and move on to the live phase)
  stay: |
    **Spend more time in beta** &mdash; the team needs to do more work to ensure the MVP meets basic user needs before moving on to the live phase
  stop: |
      **Stopping after the beta phase is not a failure.**
      <br/>The user needs you discovered and validated earlier in earlier phases may have changed. Or the technical and/or policy landscape may have changed.
      <br/>These kinds of changes can impact whether or not your MVP provides value by meeting basic user needs.
      <br/>If you're considering stopping (or pausing) the project, the key questions to answer are:

        * Does this MVP provide value to your users?
        * Can it provide that value given the technical and policy landscape?

       It's ok to pause a project (or stop it altogether). And it's better to find this out in beta, rather than after you launch it.
