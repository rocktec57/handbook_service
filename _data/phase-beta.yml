    Map out a beta plan that groups the user stories and features from your MVP backlog into small, testable chunks that you can build, deploy, and test iteratively.

    Then use your beta plan to

    #### 1. Develop incrementally by coding locally and deploying to staging as you go

    * See the <a title="Go to developer workflow" href="https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/docs/vets-developer-docs/development-workflow.html" target="_blank">example development workflow</a>.

    * Do automated testing each time you deploy to staging.

      * <a title="Go to 508 testing" href="https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/docs/building-and-testing/automated-testing" target="_blank">Automated accessibility (508 compliance) testing</a>
      * <a title="Go to testing" href="https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/docs/vets-developer-docs/vets-website/forms/tests" target="_blank">Automated unit and end-to-end tests</a>

    #### 2. Plan and conduct [research sprints](related/user-research#plan-a-research-sprint)

      * Focus on <a title="Go to usability testing" href="https://methods.18f.gov/validate/usability-testing/" target="_blank">usability testing</a> to ensure that your staged user stories and features work well for your users.

      * Analyze and synthesize the user feedback you've collected.
      * Document your research findings.
      * Use your research findings to refine your beta plan &mdash; adjusting existing features and adding new features (if these are critical to supporting your users' basic needs).

    #### 3. Repeat this cycle

      * *Until* you've deployed all the features you planned for the MVP service

      * *Or, until* the MVP provides value by meeting basic user needs

    **Note**: Some of these tasks impact each other. For example, if you change the information architecture, you'll need to test and QA again, and you may need to update the metrics you've set up in Google Analytics.

    #### 1. Finalize the [information architecture](related/other-resources/info-architecture) for your service

    * <a title="email us" href="mailto:elizabeth.hunt@va.gov">Contact the DSVA team</a> to coordinate.

    #### 2. Finalize [ATO](related/other-resources/ato) details

    * <a title="email us" href="mailto:elizabeth.hunt@va.gov">Contact the DSVA team</a> to coordinate.

    #### 3. Finalize [marketing and communications materials](related/other-resources/marcom)

    #### 4. Conduct <a title="Go to qa testing" href="https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/docs/building-and-testing/qa" target="_blank">end-to-end QA testing</a>

    #### 5. Set up and test <a title="Go to Google Analytics setup" href="https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/docs/vets-developer-docs/google-analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>

    #### 6. Load test your service

    #### 7. Perform [user acceptance testing (UAT)](related/other-resources/uat)

    #### 8. Set up [live service details](related/other-resources/service-details)

    #### 9. Review your MVP with [VA's 508 office](related/other-resources/va508)

    #### 10. Review your MVP with the [Call Center](related/other-resources/call-center)<br/><br/>

    #### By the end of beta, your team should have the following

    * A fully-functioning version of your service that meets your users' basic needs
    * A list of major bugs and usability issues that have been identified and fixed
    * Documentation of the user research and testing you did in the beta phase
    * The metrics you'll use to measure your service's success
    * A prioritized backlog of features you plan to build in order to improve the service after launch
    * A proposed plan for how you'll improve the service after you launch it &mdash; how you'll monitor, evaluate, user research/test, and build from your backlog
    * An updated resource plan (if you need additional people or other resources for the live phase)
