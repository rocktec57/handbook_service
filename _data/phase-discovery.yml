    #### Timeframe

    It's important to start the project by putting a time constraint on your discovery work. Plan to spend
      * 2 to 4 weeks for a new feature
      * 4 to 8 weeks for a new service

    #### The team you need

    See [team structure](related/other-resources/team-structure) to understand the skillsets you'll need throughout the service lifecycle.

    #### At the end of discovery

    At least a week before discovery ends, schedule a [Next Steps checkpoint](related/other-resources/next-steps-checkpoint) to share your team's recommended next steps (and your reasons).

    #### Focus on answering these key questions

    * Who are your users?
    * What are they trying to do? What tasks are they trying to accomplish?
    * How do they do that currently?
    * What problems or frustrations do they experience in trying to achieve their goals?
    * What do users need from your service to achieve their goals?
    * If your research findings show a need for the service, how would you start building a technical solution?

    #### Using these activities

    * Define a **[problem statement](related/other-resources/problem-statement)** that you think your service will solve for your users
    * Conduct **[user research](related/user-research)** to learn about potential users of your service through interviews, observation, and testing
    * Decide who the primary user groups will be
    * Analyze any existing VA or private-sector services that meet user needs
    * Understand current VA policy, technology, and business process related to your service
    * Identify policies or other barriers that could make it difficult to meet user needs
    * Review the <a title="Go to developer documentation" href="https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/docs/vets-developer-docs/getting-started" target="_blank">**developer documentation**</a> and conduct **[technical discovery](related/other-resources/technical-discovery)**
    * Document findings from your user research and technical exploration
    * Use insights from your findings to create a plan for what the team will work on during the alpha phase

    #### By the end of discovery, your team should have answers to these questions

    * What user problems and needs will the service solve (what is the scope of the service)?
    * What are the specific user needs and user stories the service will address?
    * What specific things do you plan to prototype and test during the alpha phase?
    * What people and/or resources do you need to support the work during the alpha phase?
    * What are the metrics you'll use to measure the success of the service, and what is your plan to get those metrics?
