### What is the *Learn and Improve* phase?

Once your service launches, it's important to continually monitor it to make sure it continues to serve the needs of its users. Work on your service is never "finished."

Without constant improvement, services can become outdated and unable to meet the evolving needs of their users. In the *Learn and Improve* phase, your goal is to use analytics and user feedback to continuously identify problems faced by your users. 

You'll solve those problems by repeating the earlier phases&#8212;research, prototype, build and test&#8212;in smaller iterations. Once you identify user problems, you'll conduct research to understand them. Then you'll prototype possible solutions, and build and test those solutions.
