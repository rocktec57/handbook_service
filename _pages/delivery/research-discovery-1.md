description: The Research + Discovery phase is not about solutions. Itâ€™s about uncovering problems. Before you start designing or building a service, you need to find out who the potential users are and what problems your service could solve for them.

### What is Research + Discovery?

It's tempting to start brainstorming solutions right away based on your understanding of your project. Doing that leads to a solution-focused design process in which your team's primary question is: How do we build the solution?

Instead focus on a user-centered design process in which your team's primary questions are: Who are the potential users of my service, and how can we design a service that meets their needs?

Your goal in the Research + Discovery phase is to **learn about real users and identify the problem(s) your service could solve for them**. The best way to do this is to [talk to real users]({{ site.baseurl}}/resources/user-research). Go out and find people who will be using the service. Talk to them, observe them, and learn what they need and want.
