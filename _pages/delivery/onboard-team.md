### General team onboarding

**Code of Conduct**

Read it.

**Github and Slack**

Github and Slack are the two primary tools we use to collaborate, share documents, and manage team workflows.

Follow the steps to [get your team set up on Github and Slack](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-work-practices/blob/master/Onboarding/github-and-slack.md).

<hr>

### Additional onboarding steps

#### For design

The design system for the Veteran Tools Platform is based on the <a title="Go to USWDS" href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/" target="_blank">United States Web Design System (USWDS)</a>, with some additional specifications to meet the needs of VAâ€™s particular audiences.

> **Our design files use <a title="Go to Sketch" href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank">Sketch App</a>, which is a Mac application.**
Designers should review the [Design guide](related/design) and [download the Sketch files](related/design#design-tools) so they can design using the latest Veteran Tools Platform templates.
