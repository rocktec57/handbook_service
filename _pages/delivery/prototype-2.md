### Key questions to answer

* What user experience (IA, interaction design, content) is best suited to serve user needs?

* What technical solutions or approaches are best suited to deliver the user experience you want?

* What technical solutions or approaches are best suited to integrate with existing Veteran Tools Platform technologies?

### Activities

#### Test hypotheses quickly

To get to a clear definition of your MVP, you'll need to test many different hypotheses. Your objective is to identify potential issues &mdash; and learn from them &mdash; while you still have time to make corrections.

There's not a one-size-fits-all set of hypotheses to test during the *Prototype* phase. *But teams who are successful in the this phase tend to use design sprints to prototype and test their hypotheses.*

A design sprint takes 1-2 weeks and is designed to solve important design or business challenges. Each design sprint starts with brainstorming activities that lead to a prototype that is tested with real users &mdash; all within the span of 1-2 weeks.

#### Identify your goals

Each design sprint takes 1-2 weeks. So in an 8-week period, you might (realistically) do 3-5 design sprints.

Start mapping out the work you plan to do in this phase by identifying your team's goals. Consider these questions:

* Based on your *Research and Discovery* findings, what **kinds of solutions** make the most sense in terms of meeting your users' needs?

* Which of those would you like to move forward with and test?

* What are the biggest **design risks** in those solutions?

* What are the biggest **technical risks** in those solutions?

* What are the biggest **business or policy risks** in those solutions?

* What are your hypotheses about those risks and solutions?

<hr>

#### Plan a design sprint

Based on the goals and hypotheses you've identified, map out your first design sprint.

* Don't test all your hypotheses at once. Target each design sprint to specific hypotheses.

* Test the most risky hypotheses first &mdash; the ones that, if your hypothesis is proven wrong, will derail your solution concept.

* Test your design/user experience hypotheses &mdash; for example, a single-page vs multi-page user flow.

* Test your technical hypotheses &mdash; for example, whether a specific Vets-API provides data in the format you need.

#### Conduct a design sprint

1. Review &mdash; review current goals, hypotheses, and solution concepts with your team.

2. Sketch &mdash; use individual and group brainstorming activities to explore design solutions that will test your hypotheses.

3. Decide &mdash; select a single option to prototype.

4. Prototype &mdash; create a a simple prototype to test the solution (see [Prototyping Tips]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/more/prototyping-tips)).

5. Test &mdash; test the prototype with real users and collect their feedback.
    * **Tip**: Your goal is to iterate quickly. So make sure you plan far enough in advance to recruit participants for each design sprint.

6. Analyze &mdash; assess the user feedback and decide how it impacts your solution concept.

7. Plan &mdash; plan your next design sprint incorporating what you've just learned into the next prototype.

    * **Tips**:
      * Involve all team members in prototyping. This leads to better design outcomes and helps the team create a common understanding of the service.
      * Learn more about design sprints at <a title="Go to google ventures" href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/" target="_blank">Google Ventures</a>, as well as <a title="Go to design sprint kit" href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com" target="_blank">Google's Design Sprint Kit</a> (a slight variation on the first link).

8. Keep iterating with your design sprints until your prototypes meet your users' basic needs and the team feels confident about moving on to the *Build and Test* phase.
