### Typical Activities

Teams will engage in different *Learn and Improve* activities depending on their service and their users. Typical activities include:


**Monitoring**
* Review Google Analytics to measure performance and user progress through the service
* Review site performance data
* Review user feedback collected from the Call Center
* Conduct surveys to collect broad feedback
* Conduct interviews and usability testing to more deeply understand the problems users identified
* Conduct user research to understand new or evolving user needs

**Analyzing**
In analyzing the data you collect through monitoring, you'll develop:
* A deeper understanding of how users experience your service
* Insight into usability, accessibility, and technical issues and how to fix them
* Ideas for ways to improve your service in the future


**Prioritizing**
As new problems are uncovered through monitoring and analysis, add new features to your backlog to fix them. Rank these features by priority.


**Building and Testing**
Use your prioritized backlog as a roadmap for building and testing improvements to your service. 
* Build and test those improvements in small iterations following the same steps as for [MVP Activities]({{site.baseurl}}/delivery/build-and-test/activities#mvp-activities).
* Conduct [Pre-launch Activities]({{site.baseurl}}/delivery/build-and-test/activities#pre-launch-activities) for each iteration.
