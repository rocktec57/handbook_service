### If you plan to retire your service

At some point, your service may no longer be needed. For example, government policy may make your service obsolete, or a different service may better meet the same user needs.

**Reach out to your DSVA Contact as soon as possible.**
You'll need to work together to create a plan to:
* Remove your service from the Veteran-facing Services Platform IA and navigation 
* Remove any links between your service and other Veteran-facing Services
* [Inform users](#informing-users) well in advance of the planned service retirement


### Informing users

Work with your DSVA Contact to develop a plan to inform users, including what happens to their data and how they can meet the needs your service previously met for them.

Make sure users know:

* What is being changed and why
* How this impacts them and their ability to have their needs met
* What will happen to their data or outstanding requests made through your service
