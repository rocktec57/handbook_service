### Focus on answering these key questions

* Who are your users?
* What are they trying to do? What tasks are they trying to accomplish?
* How do they do that currently?
* What problems or frustrations do they experience in trying to achieve their goals?
* What do users need from your service to achieve their goals?
* If your research findings show a need for the service, how would you start building a technical solution?

#### Using these activities

* Define a **[problem statement](related/other-resources/problem-statement)** that you think your service will solve for your users
* Conduct **[user research](related/user-research)** to learn about potential users of your service through interviews, observation, and testing
* Decide who the primary user groups will be
* Analyze any existing VA or private-sector services that meet user needs
* Understand current VA policy, technology, and business process related to your service
* Identify policies or other barriers that could make it difficult to meet user needs
* Review the <a title="Go to developer documentation" href="https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/docs/vets-developer-docs/getting-started" target="_blank">**developer documentation**</a> and conduct **[technical discovery](related/other-resources/technical-discovery)**
* Document findings from your user research and technical exploration
* Use insights from your findings to create a plan for what the team will work on during the alpha phase
