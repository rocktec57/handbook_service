### Veteran-centered Digital Delivery

The Veteran Tools Platform is based on a Veteran-centered delivery process to create modern, user-friendly services for Veterans.

Our primary goal is to understand Veterans who use our services in order to create solutions that work for them. This helps teams make decisions about digital services based on observation and analysis of Veteran needs (vs. relying on their assumptions).

Throughout the *Digital Delivery* lifecycle, teams engage with Veterans by:

* Conducting user research to learn about Veterans and their needs
* Testing possible solutions (prototypes) with Veterans
* Continuously improving the service after it launches so that it continues to serve Veteran needs
