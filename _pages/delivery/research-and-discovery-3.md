### By the end of discovery, your team should have answers to these questions


<div class="bullet-checkmark" markdown="1">


* What user problems and needs will the service solve (what is the scope of the service)?

* What are the specific user needs and user stories the service will address?

* What specific things do you plan to prototype and test during the alpha phase?

* What people and/or resources do you need to support the work during the alpha phase?

* What are the metrics you'll use to measure the success of the service, and what is your plan to get those metrics?
