### Expectations

Teams working on the Veteran-facing Services Platform are required to have "Technical" as a skillset, including architecture, development, quality assurance, testing, and deployment (see [Team Roles]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/more/team-structure#team-roles)).

Teams working on the Veteran-facing Services Platform are responsible for building services that follow guidelines in this Technical guide and in the <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-external-teams/tree/master/DeveloperDocs" target="_blank">Veteran-facing Services Platform Developer Documentation</a>.

If you have any questions, ask your DSVA contact.
