### Using the Content guide

{% for item in page.sections %}
* [{{ item}}](#{{item | downcase | replace: ' ', '-'}})
{% endfor %}

### Expectations

Teams working on the Veteran Tools Platform are required to have "Content Strategy/Writing" as a skillset (see [Team Roles]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/more/team-structure#team-roles)).

Teams working on the Veteran Tools Platform are responsible for creating well-written, plain language content for their services. This content must adhere to the guidelines and rules laid out in the Content Style Guide.

If you have any questions, ask your DSVA contact.

### Content style guide

Our content style guide evolves as we learn new information about how Veterans think about the services we provide.
