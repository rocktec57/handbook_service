### Using the Agile guide

{% for item in page.sections %}
* [{{ item}}](#{{item | downcase | replace: ' ', '-'}})
{% endfor %}

### Expectations

Teams working on the Veteran Tools Platform are required to practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" target="_blank">agile software development</a>. Teams working on the Veteran Tools Platform are responsible for organizing their own work into Epics, User Stories, and related sprints and code.

Because teams are all working on the same platform, *teams must use the same agile tools in the same way.* We do that using Github Issues and Zenhub (see [Managing your agile workflow](#managing-your-agile-workflow)).

If you have any questions, ask your DSVA contact.

### Managing your agile workflow

Every Github repository (repo) has a section called "Issues." <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/" target="_blank">Learn about Github Issues</a>.

The "Issues" section of the <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team" target="_blank">vets.gov-team repo</a> is where all teams working on the Veteran Tools Platform manage their Epics, User Stories, and agile workflow. *After completing the onboarding steps, you'll be able to see the vets.gov-team repo.*

All teams manage their agile workflow in 2-week sprints using Github and a Github integration called Zenhub, which turns Github Issues into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)" target="_blank">scrum board</a>.

* Get started [using Zenhub](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Work%20Practices/Onboarding%20and%20Offboarding/zenhub_onboarding.pdf).
{{ site.vets-team }}

* See [how we use Zenhub for agile workflow](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Work%20Practices/Product%20Management/zenhub_product_management.pdf).
