### Using the agile delivery guide


#### Github and Zenhub

The DSVA team manages its agile workflow using Github and a Github integration called <a title="go to Zenhub" href="https://zenhub.com" target="_blank">Zenhub</a>, which turns Github issues into a project board.

* To get started with Zenhub, <a title="go to Zenhub overview" href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Work%20Practices/Onboarding%20and%20Offboarding/zenhub_onboarding.pdf" target="_blank">see this guide</a>
