### What is a problem statement?

Discovery research starts with some kind of hypothesis, for example, that turning a specific paper form into a digital experience will make it easier for Veterans to access a specific VA benefit.

Begin by stating what you believe to be true about your users, their challenges, and their needs. Then define your problem statement by answering these questions

* Who is the user?
* What are they trying to achieve?
* How do they currently do that?
* Where do they face challenges, and why?
* How might we make those easier?

In discovery, you won't ***know the answers*** to these questions. But it's best to be explicit about your current hypotheses. The problem statement (and solution hypothesis) will evolve as you learn new information through research and technical discovery. That's part of the process &mdash; keep refining both as your project moves forward.

### Example problem statement

As a Veteran, I want to be able to receive benefits and discounts that I’m entitled to with my Veteran status. Right now, I have to carry around my DD214 to prove my Veteran status. But it’s risky to do so because it contains a lot of personal information that would be exposed if I lost my DD214.

### Example solution hypothesis

By letting Veterans apply for a Veteran ID Card online, we can provide users with a simple way to prove their Veteran status without having to carry around their DD214.
