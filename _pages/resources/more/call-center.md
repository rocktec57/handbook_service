### Review your service with the Call Center

The call center is an important resource for answering Veterans' questions and helping them navigate when they get stuck.

When you're confident you've thoroughly testing your MVP and it's ready to launch, create a product guide for the Call Center team. The product guide helps the Call Center understand the details of your service so they can help Veterans who have questions about it.

The product guide should show screenshots of each screen of the user journey. You should also show how people navigate to the service. It's especially important to explain any unique scenarios, as well as the possible error messages (and notifications) a user might experience with your service.

* See an [example product guide]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/docs/sample-product-guide.pdf)
