### Using the research guide

{% for item in page.sections %}
* [{{ item}}](#{{item | downcase | replace: ' ', '-'}})
{% endfor %}

<!--### User research and the Paperwork Reduction Act

The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) limits the burden placed on people when interacting with the federal government. *To avoid going through the (often lengthy) PRA approval process, stay within PRA limits.*

PRA does allow you to observe people and ask them questions about the experience you are observing. However, some pre- and post-research activities must follow PRA guidelines.

<Follow the PRA guidance we've included in the sections below. If you're not certain if an activity is subject to PRA, [contact the DSVA team](../../contact).

### User privacy

Whatever people say or do during user research sessions is considered private information that your team must protect.

**Tips**:
* Don't post recruiting files with names, emails, or phone numbers. Keep these locally on your computer.
* All session notes should to refer to research participants as "Participant 1", "Participant 2", and so on. Any PII in the session notes must be deleted before posting or sharing with your team.
* If audio or video recordings contain PII, you must delete that information before posting or sharing the files with your team.

### Create a research plan

Create a research plan at the start of each development phase, especially discovery, alpha, and beta. Then regularly update your research plan as you learn more about your users.

{% for group in site.data.research-guide %}

  {% if group[0] == 'plan' %}

  <ul class="usa-accordion">

    {% for item in group[1] %}
      {% if forloop.first %}
      <li>
        <button class="usa-accordion-button"
          aria-expanded="true"
          aria-controls="{{ item.number}}">
          {{ item.title }}
        </button>
        <div id="{{ item.number }}" class="usa-accordion-content">

          {{ item.copy | markdownify }}

        </div>
      </li>      
      {% else %}
      <li>
        <button class="usa-accordion-button"
          aria-controls="{{ item.number}}">
          {{ item.title }}
        </button>
        <div id="{{ item.number }}" class="usa-accordion-content">

          {{ item.copy | markdownify }}

        </div>
      </li>
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}

  </ul>

  {% endif %}

{% endfor %}

### Plan a research sprint

This [research sprint planning template](other-resources/research-sprints) may be useful as you're planning your research sprint.

{% for group in site.data.research-guide %}

  {% if group[0] == 'sprints' %}

  <ul class="usa-accordion">

    {% for item in group[1] %}
      {% if forloop.first %}
      <li>
        <button class="usa-accordion-button"
          aria-expanded="true"
          aria-controls="{{ item.number}}">
          {{ item.title }}
        </button>
        <div id="{{ item.number }}" class="usa-accordion-content">

          {{ item.copy | markdownify }}

        </div>
      </li>
      {% else %}
      <li>
        <button class="usa-accordion-button"
          aria-controls="{{ item.number}}">
          {{ item.title }}
        </button>
        <div id="{{ item.number }}" class="usa-accordion-content">

          {{ item.copy | markdownify }}

        </div>
      </li>  
      {% endif %}    
    {% endfor %}

  </ul>

  {% endif %}
