### Development

To build a service on the Veteran Tools Platform, which can be anything from a digital form to a map-based facility locator, developers will create a Frontend experience in React on Vets-Website, and connect it to an Integration on Vets-API, which manages the data flow to and from VA systems.

**Code repositories**
The Veteran Tools Platform is broken into three parts:
1. <a title="Go to Vets-Website" href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website" target="_blank">Vets-Website</a>, which contains frontend applications and components users interact with
2. <a title="Go to Vets-API" href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api" target="_blank">Vets-API</a>, a JSON-based API used by the frontend to provide data to and from VA systems
3. <a title="Go to Vets-JSON-Schema" href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-json-schema" target="_blank">Vets-JSON-Schema</a>, which contains shared resources used to structure and validate form data between Vets-Website and Vets-API.
