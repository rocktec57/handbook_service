### Planning for user research

There are a wide variety of methods to help you understand your users and what they need and want. And there are lots of great resources online if you want to learn about the broad category of user research (see [Resources](#tools-resources-and-examples)).

> User research is only valuable if it helps you answer questions that are blocking your team from moving forward.
<br/>No matter what method you choose, your first step is to clearly define what you want to get out of the research.

#### Create your research plan

Work with your team to define your research objectives and decide how you’ll approach the research.

You can document your research plan [using this template]({{site.data.resources.research-plan-template}}). See [an example]({{site.data.resources.research-plan-ex}}).

1. Agree on your research questions

    Run a [team workshop]({{site.data.resources.workshop-research-questions}}) to capture and prioritize your research questions. Knowing the questions you need to answer &mdash; and the assumptions you need to test &mdash; will help you focus on the most important things your team needs to know.

    In discovery, your research questions are likely to be broad and evolve quickly as you learn. They should become more specific in later development phases, as you focus on particular user groups and parts of your service.

2. Identify user groups and research methods
  Decide who you need to research with. Depending on what you need to learn, this could include all the different users of your service, or just specific groups.

  In the discovery phase for a new service, you may not have a clear idea of who your potential users will be. Research this as a priority.

  As you learn about your users, you can create personas or profiles to capture and present what you’ve learned.

  You also need to decide which research methods to use. Your choices will depend on what you want to learn and the development phase you’re in.

  Choose research activities that will provide strong evidence and reliable answers to your questions, for the least time, effort and cost.

  If the team doesn’t have much experience with user research, choose simple methods like interviews and usability testing that your team can easily understand and join in with.

3. Map out research sprints
  Once you’ve decided on your research questions, user groups and research methods, start planning your research sprints.

  Each research sprint should answer specific research questions with specific user groups. A sprint usually lasts about two weeks, beginning from when you recruit users to when you complete your research findings.

  **Tips**:
    * Aim to do at least one round of research every 2-3 weeks.
    * Be flexible. As you learn more from each research sprint, revise your later research sprints accordingly. For example, a question answered in Sprint #1 may mean that Sprint #2 should answer different questions than you originally planned.

4. Focus on your most important questions
  Prepare just the research sprints you need to answer your highest priority questions. You can arrange more research sprints as you learn more about your users and your service.

  As you prepare more research sprints, make sure they're scheduled so that the findings feed into the appropriate design or development sprints. We generally use the "sprint-ahead" model, in which research sprints happen 1 sprint before a design sprint, and 2 sprints before a development sprint.

  aligned with your team's roadmap/schedule and that research sprints are designed to answer questions that the team has per the schedule.

  **Tips**:
    * Focus your research sprints on the most immediate questions to be answered. Don’t do lots of research that the team can’t respond to, or get left behind if they’re making quick progress.

5. Recruit participants
  The number of people you need to research with in each research sprint will depend on the method you’re using.

  For qualitative research methods like contextual research, user interviews, and usability testing, we generally aim for 4-8 participants.

  For quantitative methods like card sorting or A/B testing, you'll need hundreds of participants to produce clear findings.

  If you need more participants to get clear findings, do more rounds rather than one big round. That way you can adjust after each round.

6. Document your research sprint plans.

7. Be inclusive
  Whenever you recruit participants from a user group, make sure you include a good variety of the users within that group.

  If your service has a broad audience, you should aim to include users with disabilities and people who may need support to use your service in every round of research.

  This may not be possible for smaller or more specialist user groups. In this case, plan specific rounds of research to:

  * look at the most significant barriers that users with disabilities are likely to face
  * identify support needs and test your support model

7. Plan ahead
  Recruiting users can take longer than you think, so start recruiting as soon as you've defined your research plan for a specific research sprint.

  **Tips**:
    * research plan link
    * recruiting call template
    * who we recruit with - decide what channels and messaging to use when looking for Veterans, their family members, VSOs, or other potential users to talk to.

8. Involve your whole team to help them stay focused on user needs
  Record your plan in a shared document or collaboration tool. Be clear what research questions each research sprint will aim to answer and how it will help the team make decisions.

  To help members get the most from your research, involve them in:

  * observing research sessions - we encourage everyone on the team to observe at least 2 hours of research every 6 weeks
  * helping with user research activities (for example, note-taking, pairing on site visits, running workshops)
  * making prototypes and other materials - like letters, leaflets or posters
  * analyzing and synthesizing results

9. Share your findings
  Agree how to feed research findings into your team’s agile tools and practices (like planning and prioritization meetings, story backlogs, and any other ways that design decisions are made).

  Make sure you have space for research on your team wall. Use it to highlight questions the team is exploring and share information about your research activities and findings.

  Store your research findings and other research outputs in your team’s collaboration tool or shared folders so it’s easy for everyone to use and share them.

  You should also make sure you have regular opportunities at show and tells and other events to share research findings with your team and with wider stakeholders.
