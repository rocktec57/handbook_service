### Planning for user research

There are a wide variety of methods to help you understand your users and what they need and want. And there are lots of great resources online if you want to learn more about the broad category of user research (see [More resources]()).

> User research is only valuable if it helps you answer questions that are blocking your team from moving forward.
<br/>So no matter what method you choose, your first step is to clearly define what you want to get out of the research.

#### Step 1: Start by asking these questions

**Given the phase you're at, what new information do you need in order for your team to move forward?**
* Do you need information about your users' pain points?
* Do you need information about what motivates (or triggers) your users use your service or to complete a task?
* Do you need information about what your users think a successful experience is?
* Do you need more information about what your users think, feel, see, hear, or say while they try to complete a task your service would offer?
* Do you need to know something specific about user pr

#### Step 2: Decide how you could learn the answers to those questions

There are lots of methods [you can use](externallink). We've found the following useful in our work on the Veteran Tools Platform.

Draft a research plan: think through what you want to validate and learn in this research, so you’re prepared to make the most of your research sessions.




* Even if you have a defined scope or solution in mind, you need to validate that with potential users before you design or build anything.
* Discovery is not about operating within an established scope. User research is a fluid process that often leads to unanticipated insights. Be flexible and open to changing your course along the way.

how impairments might affect your users - for example, visual, hearing, motor and cognitive (memory and thinking) impairments
how many of your users need assisted digital support and what their needs are
