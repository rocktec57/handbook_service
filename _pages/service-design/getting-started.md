### Onboarding your team

**Github**
Veteran Tools Platform teams use <a title="Go to VA Github" href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs" target="_blank">Github</a> for sharing project documents. We do this so all Veteran Tools Platform teams can learn from what other teams are doing.

Starting in the Alpha phase, your developers will start integrating with the Veteran Tools Platform release management process. We use Github Issues to manage that process.

To get started
1. Have everyone on your team create a Github account. Github requires Two-Factor authentication (2FA) to create an account.
2. [Email a list](mailto:{{ site.contact-handbook.email }}) of all names, email addresses, and Github usernames for your team.
  * Indicate which people on the list are developers (so we can give developer access to the right people).
  * **Have each developer on your team <a title="Go to help" href="https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/docs/vets-developer-docs/internal-tools-access#ssh-key" target="_blank">create new SSH keys</a>**.
  * **Important** &mdash; include each developer's **public SSH key** on the list.
  * Make sure developers send the **public SSH key** (not the SSH fingerprint).<br/>The public SSH key format looks like <code>ssh-rsa [long string]</code>
5. We'll add the people on the list to the VA Github organization and
  * Give everyone access to a team folder on Github, which you'll use to store and share project documents
  * Provide the developers with access to code repositories and the tools they'll need to develop on the Veteran Tools Platform
7. If your team is new to Github, we can arrange a short meeting to show you how to use it share documents.

**Slack**

* We'll create a <a title="Go to Slack" href="https://slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> channel for your team to use. This channel may include people from other Veteran Tools Platform teams working on a similar service, so you can share findings and ask each other questions.
<!--* We'll also give you access to the *#dsva-platform-project channel*, which you can use if you have questions about the process described in this Handbook.-->

### Tools for designers

The design system for the Veteran Tools Platform is based on the <a title="Go to USWDS" href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/" target="_blank">United States Web Design System (USWDS)</a>, with some additional specifications to meet the needs of VAâ€™s particular audiences.

> **Our design files use <a title="Go to Sketch" href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank">Sketch App</a>, which is a Mac application.**
<br/>Designers should download the Sketch files from the [design guide](related/design) so they can design using the latest Veteran Tools Platform templates.

### Tools for developers

Once a developer's Github account is added to the VA Github organization and their SSH public key is set up, they'll be given access to the code repositories, credentials for shared testing environments, and internal tools.

Developers should review the [technical guide](related/technical) to complete the onboarding steps and confirm that they have access to all the tools.
