### Start with the lowest fidelity possible

Prototypes only need to be **realistic enough to get meaningful feedback** that you can incorporate into your next prototype.

In early design sprints, your prototypes can be
* Simple paper sketches
* Wireframes that use images to show the functional elements of your service
* Clickable mockups that mimic the functionality of your service (<a title="Go to example" href="" target="_blank">see an example</a>)

<br/>

### Use the prototype to answer questions

Think of each prototype as a proof of concept and use it to answer these questions:

* Do you have the right solution that meets your users' needs?
* Is your solution approach viable?
* Do the technologies exist to implement your solution?
* Do you understand how to use and/or integrate those technologies into our solution?
* Are there any parts of the solution that won't be easy to build or change later? If so, are you comfortable moving forward despite these?
* Are there existing processes or policies that will need to change to support your service?

### Mimic (rather than build exactly)

In later prototypes, you can start mimicking your service's working logic. But this does not necessarily require back-end integration.

You'll build the actual integrations in the beta phase. Use the alpha phase to figure out **how you'll do that** from a technical perspective. And only build and test the parts of the integration critical to **making decisions about how to build** them.
