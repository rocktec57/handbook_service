### In progress !

### Information architecture

**Create a name for your service** (if it's a brand new service)

* Be sure to test the service name with your users.
* As soon as possible, you should [contact the DSVA team](mailto:{{ site.contact-handbook.email }}) to make sure the name you've chosen doesn't collide with any other services.


#### Create URLs and page names
  * Follow the [information architecture (IA) guidelines and process]({{ "related/other-resources/ia" | relative_url}}). Because your service will integrate into the existing Veteran Tools Platform, you need to [coordinate with the DSVA team](mailto:{{ site.contact-handbook.email }}) on this.

  * **Tip**: Some user research (e.g., card sort, tree test, or interviews) may be needed to arrive at the best URLs or page names, so plan ahead for this step.
