### What is the Next Steps checkpoint?

A Next Steps checkpoint happens after the discovery, alpha, and beta phases. It's designed to ensure
* Your team's work meets the [Digital Standard]({{ "digital-standard" | relative_url }})
* Your service is consistent with the rest of the Veteran Tools Platform

<hr>

{% for item in page.sections %}
* [{{ item}}](#{{item | downcase | replace: ' ', '-'}})
{% endfor %}

<hr>

### Scheduling

* The checkpoints typically last 1.5 hours and are usually scheduled for Mondays or Wednesday mornings.

* At least a week before discovery ends, [send an email](mailto:{{ site.contact-handbook.email }}) with possible dates and times when your team can meet with us.

### Who attends

* Your entire team (remote attendance is fine)
* 1 to 3 Digital Service at VA team members, depending on what phase you're at

### How to prepare

At each Next Steps checkpoint, you'll talk about your team's recommended next steps (and your reasons).

The best way to prepare is to review

* The questions you wanted to answer during this phase
* The activities your team did to answer those questions
* What you learned from those activities
* Any outstanding questions you might have
* How what you've learned has impacted your plans for the next phase

You should also review the [Digital Standard]({{ "digital-standard" | relative_url }}) so you're able to talk about which activities met which standards.

We recommend preparing a presentation to guide the conversation. Post this in your Github folder so other Veteran Tools Platform teams can learn from your team's work.

### What to expect

The purpose of the Next Steps checkpoint is to ensure your team has met the [Digital Standard](../../digital-standard) and feels confident about moving to the next phase.

We expect your team to come to the meeting with a [recommended outcome](#possible-outcomes). Based on the meeting conversation, together we may decide a different outcome.

### Possible outcomes

* **Move on to next phase** &mdash; The team feels confident they've answered the key questions and are ready to move to the next phase
* **Spend more time in current phase** &mdash; The team has additional questions that need to be answered before moving to the next phase
* **Stop the project** &mdash; The research findings from this phase indicate that the project should be stopped
  > **Stopping the project is not a failure.**
  <br/>Our goal is to understand users and find out what they need. This may mean you need to change plans or take a new direction. **Finding this out before launching is the best possible outcome.**
  <br/>Your team should recommend stopping if your findings show
    > * There's no user need for the service you planned to build
    > * User needs are already being met by another service &mdash; whether government or private-sector
    > * Technology or policy constraints mean you won’t be able to build a service that meets the user needs you have found
    > * It’s not cost-effective to develop the service
