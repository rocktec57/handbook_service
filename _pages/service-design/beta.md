### What is Beta?

In the beta phase, it's tempting to try to build all the features and functionality you imagine for your service. But stay focused on your vision for the MVP. **As soon as your service can provide value by meeting basic user needs, itâ€™s ready to launch!**

During beta, you'll build the user stories and features from your backlog in small batches of functionality. As you build these batches, you'll test them with your users to ensure they work well. Then you'll use that user feedback to refine your service, adding and adjusting features until your MVP service is complete.
