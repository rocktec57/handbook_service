### What is Beta?

In the alpha phase, your team created a prioritized list of user stories and features (the backlog) for your MVP. Your goal in the beta phase is to turn that backlog into a working version of your service, which you'll launch at the end of the beta phase.

During beta, you'll build the user stories and features from your backlog in small batches of functionality. As you build these batches, you'll test them with your users to ensure they work well. Then you'll use that user feedback to refine your service, adding and adjusting features until your MVP service is complete.

In the beta phase, it's tempting to try to build all the features and functionality you imagine for your service. But stay focused on your MVP. **As soon as your service can provide value by meeting your users' basic needs, itâ€™s ready to launch!**

> The backlog is never complete. Throughout the beta and lives phases, you'll collect new user feedback and update your backlog with more features and improvements.

The following sections will guide you in meeting the Digital Standard for beta.

### Planning for beta

Different services will spend different amounts of time in beta, depending on what the team plans to build as the MVP. In general, plan to spend
  * 6-8 weeks for a new feature
  * 8-12 weeks for a new service
  * **Tip**: If your planned MVP will take longer than 12 weeks to build and test, you should reconsider the [scope of your MVP](alpha#scoping-your-mvp) &mdash; make it smaller!

#### The team you need

See [team structure](related/other-resources/team-structure) to understand the skillsets you'll need throughout the service lifecycle.

#### At the end of beta

At least a week before beta ends, schedule a [Next Steps checkpoint](related/other-resources/next-steps-checkpoint) to share your team's recommended next steps (and your reasons).
