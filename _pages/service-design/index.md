### What is service design?

Service Design helps us understand the people who use services on the Veteran Tools Platform in order to create solutions that work for them. Our goal is to make decisions about Veteran services based on observation and analysis of Veteran needs (vs. relying on our assumptions).

Using service design methods, we engage with our users throughout the service lifecycle:

* Conducting user research to learn about users and their needs
* Testing possible solutions (prototypes) with users
* Continuously testing the live service to check that it continues to serve user needs
