### What is service design?

Service Design helps us to understand the people who will use a service in order to create solutions that work for them.

Service Design uses these methods to engage with users throughout the lifecycle of any service:
* Conduct user research to learn about users and their needs
* Test possible solutions (prototypes) with users
* Continuously test the live service with users to check that it continues to serve their needs

Using these methods ensures that we make decisions based on observations about users and their needs (rather than relying on our assumptions).
