### What is Discovery?

It's tempting to start brainstorming solutions right away based on your understanding of your project. Doing that leads to a solution-focused design process in which your team's primary question is: How do we build the solution?

Instead focus on a user-centered design process in which your team's primary questions are: Who are the potential users of my service, and how can we design a service that meets their needs?

Your goal in the discovery phase is to **learn about real users and identify the problem(s) your service could solve for them**. The best way to do this is to [talk to real users](related/user-research). Go out and find people who will be using the service. Talk to them, observe them, and learn what they need and want.
