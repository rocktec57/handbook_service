#### Development

This is a Jekyll-built static site.

1. Clone/fork this repo.
2. For best results (urls work correctly), run locally at 127.0.0.1:4000/va-digital-service-handbook/

    ```
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

3. Whenever you make a change to content, also change the ```modified-date``` in the yml at the top of the relevant ```.md``` file.

    * The ```modified-date``` is pulled into the ```footer.html``` include for all pages, except for the Home page.
    * For the Home page, the ```modified-date``` is pulled into the ```home.html``` layout.

<hr>

<a name="fn1"></a>The *Veteran Tools Platform* is the set of technologies (and processes) that run the current [Vets.gov](https://www.vets.gov/) website. VA teams who want to release a digital service for veterans using the Veteran Tools Platform should use this [Handbook](http://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-service-handbook/) to learn how to do that.

* In the short-term, veteran digital services built using the Veteran Tools Platform will be accessible through the Vets.gov domain.
* In the future, veteran digital services built using the Veteran Tools Platform will be accessible through the VA.gov domain.
